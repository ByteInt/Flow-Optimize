# Flow-Optimize

This project aims to create a program to control the apparatus in a flow chemistry reactor.

There are basically four parts to be created.

1. Connection and Control: to connect to the apparatus used in one experiment.

2. Experiment Method: to describe the quipment behavior in one repeat.

3. Parameters Setting: to set parameters as fixed or optimize this parameter.

4. Optimize: a series of algorithms can be selected to automatically optimize the reaction parameters.
